    <h3>Now, you may be wondering, why did I choose this as my essential question?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I chose this as my essential question because of my fascination with science, specifically, Neuroscience.</p>
    <p>I also chose this question because the other questions I had were weird (to me, at least), not the best for research, or they didn't fascinate me as much as this.</p>
    <p>I wanted to make a project that would stand out, and choose something I would enjoy creating.</p>
    <br>
    <font size="+1">I chose to make a webpage using HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), everything here was built from scratch.</font>

    <h3>How does the brain store and retrieve memories?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>In the past few decades of neurological research, scientists thorize that when a memory is evoked, it is open to changes, so parts of the memory could be spliced out or changed. This is the theory that could explain false memories, when you are sure something happened when in reality, it didn't.</p>
    <p>Strong emotional memories are much more detailed than "normal" memories, which is why sometimes when you remember something, you feel an emotion, such as anger or sadness.</p>
    <p>"Working" (Short-term) memory is stored in many ways, remembering it can take forms of repeating it in your head, like with your student id or libary card.</p>
    <p>There are <b><i>very many</i></b> different types of memory, including short-term, long-term, explicit, implicit, and more.</p>
    <p>Memories are "coded" into the brain in varying ways.</p>

    <h3>What happens in your brain when you make a memory?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>"People compare the brain to the computer, but we can't learn by jamming a flash drive into our ear, that'd be convienient, if a little painful."</p>
    <p>     -Dean Burnett</p>
    <p>
Short-term memory is thought to last around a day, in actuality, it lasts for an average of 15-30 seconds. Anything beyond that is considered a long-term memory.</p>

    <p>Explicict memory is something you do while you are <i>aware</i> of what you're doing.</p>
    <p>Implicit memory is something you do while you are <i>unaware</i> of what you are doing, it is instinctive.</p>
    <p>Long-term memory is a "physical" thing.</p>
    <font size="-2">Just so you have an existential crisis, all your memories are just electrical signals, your memories are <i>lies</i>. Heh, please don't make me regret typing this out...</font>

    <h3>Parts of the brain and memories.</h3>
    <br>
    <p><IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:820px; RIGHT:0px; WIDTH:550px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Blausen_0102_Brain_Motor%26Sensory_%28flipped%29.png">It is calculated that humans have approximately 100 billion nerve cells/neurons/"brain cells" in their, well... brain.</p>
    <p>Neurons are "trigger happy", which means they are <b><i>very responsive</i></b> to electrical signals.</p>
    <p>It is thought that humans are around 1 trillion synaptic connections, a synaptic connection is shown by the image to the right of the screen.</p>
    <p>Our neurons give us the ability to experience emotion.</p>
    <p>Unlike most cells, neurons don't divide. If a neuron is destroyed, any memory that went with it will either have missing parts, be forgotten, or the memory would be fuzzy.</p>
    <p>If you still want to compare the brain to a computer, then the brain would have a storage capacity of around 1-1000 terabytes. Though there are people that think the memory capacity for the brain is infinite.</p>
    <p>Neurons have a soma (The thing that contains the nucleus, dendrites (Long and feather-like), and the axon "tail", which can be thousands of times the length of the soma.</p>

    <h2>Does the brain govern where memories are stored?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I believe the answer is <i>no</i>. I say this because after extensive research, I have determined that the only thing the brain really governs about memory, is if it is to be a short-term or long-term memory. For example, if you have to memorize something for a test, and you remember it for the test, that would be a long-term memory; you remembered the things when you needed it and remembered them well.</p>
    <p>If you thought you knew something very clearly but you got a question wrong, then that would be because of something I explained earlier with memory splicing and changing.</p>
    <p>If you were going to a friend's house and you needed to remember their address, that would be working memory, or short-term memory. You'll only remember it for a short period of time unless you find a way to keep remembering it. Though because you have to actively think about it, this is considered short-term memory, or, again, "working memory".  </p>
